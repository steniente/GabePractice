							<p class="para"> When all the pieces came together, we finally met Sally! We also created personas and user stories for our other profiles.. 
								We discovered The Health Museum needed more enaging and interesting topics. The top 4 topics were; The history of medical science, The body as art, The Texas Medical Center,
								and Popculture & Health. We knew it needed to be more interactive, fun, and have easy to understand high-level content like the nearby "Childrens Museum". </p>

								In addition, the case study and deliverables were used to reformat the marketing website, online ticket sales platform, and social media presence.

								I am so honered to be apart of that journey and help our surrounding communities.

							<h4>Project Goal</h4>
							<p class="para"> In june of 2008 CRCU had a website that looked straight from the 1990’s! 
								Table design, HTML 4.0, and inline style sheets were deprecating. Adobe Flash was taking it's course on desktops but did'nt include the new mobile devices in the market.
								Our marketing team was tasked with creating a beautiful and easy to navigate website. Our goal was to target new memberships, increase loan revenue,
								 and enage with our online audience. 

								
							<!--(What specific problem, user needs, business requirements and/or pain points that the project solves.

							<H4>My role </H4>
							<p class="para"> As a marketing specialist I collaborated with the senior vp of marketing and marketing director to revamp crcu.org.
								We worked closely with Digital Insight (An online banking platform) to implement a custom CMS and produce the website according to the latest web technolgy and brand standards. </p>
							<!-- <H4>Tools & Deliverables</H4> -->

							<h4>The challenge:</h4> 
							<p class="para"> How could we make our little credit union website look just as impresive like the big banks? Our team started with researching competitors website, profiling members data, wire-framing, 
								mock-ups and hifi-prototyping.
							</p>
							
							<h4>Solution:</h4> 
							<p class="para"> Apart from everything looking outdated, My knowledge of Gestalt theory, composition, and layout was challenge by overseeing the UI and UX development. 
								We organized the information heavy content using the card sorting method so users can have a good user experience while quickly looking for products, services, calculators etc. 
								For aesthetics, I used hyper realistic isolated imagery to create intuitive icons that resulted in quick and easy navigation.
								
								</p>
							<!--(What method/process were used to solve specific problem, user needs, business requirements and/or pain points? How did features address the objectives?) -->
							
							<h4>Results:</h4>
							<p class="para"> Numerous full blown multi channel digital media campaigns (Email designs, social media, landing pages etc. ) drove record high analytics to the new redesigned crcu.org. 
								With a new online user expereince, our Marketing team reached it's annual marketing goals and was able to surpase the highest CU assets in over 10 years. 
								CRCU won 1st and 2nd place at the Credit Union National Association awards in marketing initiatives.  Memberships, loans inquirys, and superceded annual marketing goals.</p>
